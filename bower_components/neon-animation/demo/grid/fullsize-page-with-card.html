      <h3 class="paper-font-title card-content">1. The "How do I get started?" Problem</h3>
      <h4 class="paper-font-subhead card-content">Users report not knowing how to get started from the home screen.</h4>
      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">Client feedback suggests that users simply don't know where to begin.
      They see five options, but they don't think it's immediately obvious what any of the options means
      or why they should start with one option over another:</p>
      <img class="flex self-center card-image"
           src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13309969/portfolio/lambda-start-initial.png">
      <p class="paper-font-caption card-content">The initial start screen on Lambda Analytika's home screen.</p>

      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">Steps have been taken to improve the situation through the
      addition of pdf and video guides,
      however these options have their own usability issues. The PDF is very long (over 200 pages!)
      and the video
      is 11 minutes long without a searchable transcript, so at best these options
      require significant user investment in finding the relevant information rather than providing
      the right information at the right time for each user.</p>
      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">At first glance, this appears to be an onboarding problem -
      providing a better onboarding experience
      could certainly make starting off in the right direction more obvious to people. But I tend to
      think onboarding is a solution to a symptom, not the root cause itself. Google Now and Siri
      are excellent examples of proactive, in-context help.</p>

      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content"><b>Onboarding:</b> the practice of quickly equipping novice
      users with the minimum amount
      of knowledge required for them to get started on their own. See
      <a href="https://www.useronboard.com/onboarding-teardowns/">
      UserOnBoard's Onboarding Teardowns</a>
      for much more on this.</p>

      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">I was inspired by some of the problems that Google Now solves, and
      decided to see if that
      might spark any ideas. Keeping in mind the '80/20 rule' really just means to focus on the problems that
      cause a disproportionate amount of issues for people, I wondered if there were a handful of most
      common types of analysis that people generally want to use, and therefore whether we can simply
      proactively generate them and suggest them to the user as examples of finished products to quickly
      demonstrate value.</p>

      <p class="paper-font-caption card-content">A materialized start page.</p>

      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">A second idea came to me about having a more interactive way of
      learning how to create an Ad Hoc
      Table, which is a typical scenario. Having clearly visible steps, an indication of progress,
      time remaining, and questions prompting feedback and more tailored help experience - with novices
      receiving more verbose help, and experts receiving a much leaner help package, for example.</p>

      <p class="paper-font-caption card-content">An interactive learning flow.</p>

      <h3 class="paper-font-title card-content">2. The "How do I see the most useful reports for me?" Problem</h3>
      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">Client feedback indicates that another usability hurdle exists at the
      point when a user,
      such as a Line Manager, wants to see a certain kind of report. The main idea with this mockup is
      to investigate whether there are some kinds of reports or views that get created/viewed
      disproportionately more than others. If so, maybe we can proactively suggest those reports with
      the necessary values prefilled? Or alternatively go even further and provide the highlight
      findings using actionable cards?</p>

      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">Here, for example, the user is getting notified that the list of
      users he or she is
      managing is
      performing better than the previous cohort.</p>
      <img class="card-image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13309969/portfolio/lambda-0-icons.png">
      <p class="paper-font-caption card-content">Proactive suggestions of meaningful and helpful reports.</p>

      <p class="paper-font-body1 card-content">If the user wants to create or view their own report,
      the following storyboard shows one idea, relying on search.

      Visually youâ€™ll notice these screens are a little different, with the current
      iconography and a floating action button.

      From here, the user clicks Search.</p>
      <img class="card-image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13309969/portfolio/lambda-1-search.png">
      <p class="paper-font-caption card-content">1 - "I want to find a report, or create it if I don't have it yet."</p>
      <img class="card-image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13309969/portfolio/lambda-2-search.png">
      <p class="paper-font-caption card-content">2 - Search can be such a powerful piece of UI - giving it
      sufficient space to showcase that. </p>
      <img class="card-image" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13309969/portfolio/lambda-3-search.png">
      <p class="paper-font-caption card-content">3 - Chunk words into discrete tags from phrases as you type, and
      suggest creating a report if there are 0 search results.</p>
