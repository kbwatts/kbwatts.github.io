      <h1>Approach</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Our approach consists of several key steps</p>
    <p>
      An opportunity exists for the partnership of established mining companies with small-scale miners and artisanal miners that are either unable to construct formal processing facilities or cannot increase recoveries based on their lack of access to capital, metallurgical or engineering experience.  The focus of high-grade, low tonnage gold mines that fall below the 350 tonne per day category, can allow for the utilization of a very large segment of the mining industry that has been otherwise dwarfed by the shadow of large bonanza-style gold deposits.  The ability to joint venture in such projects would assist the small-scale and artisanal miners in developing increased revenues by helping to provide capital for equipment, construction, engineering and exploration.  In exchange, the speculative risks can be minimized by partnering with local, producing miners for a portion of the increased returns as a result of the investment.  Capital would be used to supply engineering expertise and equipment which can  ultimately be recouped or moved should the operation not meet expectations.  It is important to mention that this approach substantially increases the acceptance level of mining by the communities in the area of the project, as they will be more integrated with the small-scale mining operation and, as well, will partake in the short-term benefits, thus helping to increase levels of sustainability for the regional mining operations.</p>
